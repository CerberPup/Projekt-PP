1. Statistics does not show correct data with data from just one day ( or period, just a guess, needs to be checked)
2. Requesting web page takes a lot of time.
3. Listbox in form with information about following relation shows wrong data for followers/following combo item selected.
4. The "Search for top (x) liking users from the last day"...brokes the things up and is not implemented.
5. "Like (x) photos from users who liked mine" - not implemented.
6. "Like all latest photos of the users I follow" takes too long - need to add the cmd for script to download 1 page of photos for each gallery for each user and change the call parameter. 
7. Related to 4. - since it brokes GUI on this page, if you use this option, go to another one and run some time-consuming action the GUI is broken as long as scripts does its job which makes the app useless.
8. I think the GUI should be scalable - windows of this size is useless if you want to show a lot of users in follow infomartion tab.
9. We should think about a button to kill the python execution. 
10. Maybe some icon ? :)
11. Add some graphics effect to the button which are under user's mouse cursor. 
12. Dropdown lists should have default values on create.
