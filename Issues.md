# Issues
- 1. ~~Statistics does not show correct data with data from just one day~~
- 2. ~~Listbox in form with information about following relation shows wrong data for followers/following combo item selected.~~
- 3. ~~Delete the "Search for top (x) liking users from the last day" label and button.~~
- 4. ~~"Like (x) photos from users who liked mine" - change message to "Like (x) photos from users who like mine last photo" and implement it.~~
- 5. ~~"Like all latest photos of the users I follow" is not working due to cleaning up the tmp files by script on relaunch causing loss of data.~~
- 6. I think the GUI should be scalable - window of this size is useless if you want to show a lot of users in follow infomartion tab.
- 7. We really want a button to kill the python execution - it should also clean up the python's temp files to make sure that they will not be used in program. ( temp files I mean galleriesDumps, likesForPhotos, photosDumps directories)
- 8. ~~Maybe some icon ? :)~~
- 9. ~~Add some graphics effect to the button which are under user's mouse cursor (shadow, fill the box with some color or something).~~
- 10. ~~Dropdown lists should have default values on create.~~
- 11. ~~Crash when try to follow/unfollow users using GUI.~~
- 12. ~~When you use the "Show all" button and then, change the tab and wait for the results on other tab, the text view is empty and data needs to be downloaded once more (we should fill this element anyway, store the result somewhere and show it when data is available).~~
- 13. ~~Add two new drop down list items for "Show"  drop down list for showing only users who are not following us (following since filled, follower since empty) and who we are not following but who are following us ( follower since filled, following since empty), implement it.~~
- 14. ~~"Like all lastest photos of the users I follow " - does not work for the users who has it's photos unassigned to any gallery - need to handle situation when the files are stored in unassignedPhotos file.~~
- 15. ~~Add number of follower/followings, etc. on the Followers Panel.~~
