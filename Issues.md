# Issues
- 1. ~~Update statistics crashes on empty database and when there is no database.~~
- 2. ~~Show "All" in followers/following tab crashes on empty database.~~
- 3. Does not implemented delay time 
- 4. ~~Crash when timers are set to 00:00~~
- 5. Set vote upcoming 150 every 6 minutes, database update every 7 minutes, db is never updated
- 6. ~~Crash on following user with " ' " sign in fullname ( I'm pretty sure that in unfollow also ) - user cong'e~~
- 7. ~~Unfollow always unfollows the same users and does not update the GUI - the users are unfollowed and we still can see the  "following since" date.~~
- 8. ~~You are able to follow / unfollow already followed user / user you are not following - must be fixed since the follow / unfollow always returns success (it's not using API).~~
