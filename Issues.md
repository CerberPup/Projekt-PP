# Issues
- 1. We really want a button to kill the python execution - it should also clean up the python's temp files to make sure that they will not be used in program. ( temp files I mean galleriesDumps, likesForPhotos, photosDumps directories)
- 2. Update statistics does not start when there is no database file in user's directory.
- 3. Update statistics crashes on empty database
- 4. Go on followers/followings tab, change the drop down list item on any but "All". Database is created empty. Then click on follow/unfollow users (with empty list) - crash, in both cases. 
- 5. Does not implemented delay time
